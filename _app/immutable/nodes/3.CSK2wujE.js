        Iâ€™m a writer, developer, and recent graduate of Wesleyan University.

        <img src="/assets/images/arrow.svg" alt="down arrow" class="arrow"/></p> <p class="about-text">I majored in Economics and East Asian Studies, but my work has primarily been in data journalism, digital humanities, and creative coding. In summer 2023, I completed the <a href="https://ledeprogram.com/">Lede Program for Data Journalism</a> at Columbia University. See my projects <a href="/#projects">here</a>.</p> <p class="about-text">My interests lie at the intersection of journalism, data, and design â€” all in service of storytelling. I enjoy writing longform deep-dives on topics I find interesting and meaningful, drawing upon my experience in research and creative writing. I also enjoy creating fun data-driven graphics, like this one for The Pudding.</p> <p class="about-text">In the past, Iâ€™ve written about music, history, literature, languages, pop culture, economics, and libraries.
